IDEA
------------
The original idea was to make "WUPHF" idea from the skit in the TV Series 'The Office' a reality, where if you get a message on social media/any way of contact it would send a 'forced' noification to ALL of them. After planning out how much time we had, we didn't think that we would have enough time to execute the program the way we wanted to. Instead we created Furiends, which is a different yet similar platform to instagram in a way...
Its similar =>
- User to user interaction (The user can click on things or they can do what they want to do as far as upload a picture or make an account)
- User sign in (Only need a username, email and password to start)
- User Interface (Similar to how COD, Instagram, Kingdom Hearts, Facebook make it easy for the user to pick up as if they have never used it before)

How its different =>
- Furiends is a dedicated website to sharing pictures of only pets and pet memes
- There are NO likes, only comments (Why would we value your pets importance based on a/multiple pictures 'likes' when you know a picture is worth a thousand words [Why ONLY leave a comment, hint hint])
- This is a word-of-mouth program or a startup program so the real 'end-goal' is limitless
- We don't have the pressure of having a global voice in what people post (How Twitter and Instagram need to monitor posts that outside their guidelines)

WHAT CAME EASY?
------------
- Following MVC
- Dividing work among everyone (Everyone knew what they wanted to do before-hand)(Frontend vs Backend, UI vs UX, api vs html routes)
- Learning new tech (Everyone was able to understand learning ejs vs handlebars; made a world of difference)
- Having a 5th group-mate to contribute to the project and share ideas with
- Coming up with the initial idea, features of the current app and futures in future development of how we want our project to look like in the [end]
- Having similar interests in animals, animal memes and pets (Doge, Long Cat)
- Sticking to the MVP (This oddly came easy because we had soo many great ideas but we also reminded each other of the MVP when we would go on a tangent with our own ideas)

CHALLENGES
------------
- Getting passport to work correctly (Cudos to Oscar for figuring it out before Graydon released the code)
- Getting the Database to talk to the HTML page via routes (Forgetting that you need to have API AND HTML routes)
- Correct Javascript Syntax (Forever forgetting to spell varibles correctly, that a "," is needed or that a ";" is needed)
- Github (Commiting changes to the same file but different lines)
- Forgetting to change the package.JSON after someone elses github commit (The feeling after seeing tons of red lines in your console after launching the program localally to test but knowing everything's right - the package.json file)
- Only having a week and a half to develop a Full Stack Web Program! (We had a couple great ideas we wanted to pursue but we felt that time would play a crucial factor considering work, kids, getting things working, deploying to heroku and NOT blowing the project up,)

FUTURE DEVELOPMENT
------------
- More user features such as finding specific breed pictures, specific users, or a user by a specific "userName"
- Background texture that changes as you scroll through the "infinite scrolling"
- An animated pet in the nav bar that walks around and you can click on for help
- Being able to organize pet meetups between users/developers (Similar to OTAB)
- Giving users more access to pet information such as breed specific info, pet friendly bars/parks, quick access to a "PetWebMD"
- Adding more users and having at least 100 frequent users so that some of these future ideas can become realities
- If it were to get to be a globaly use program we would have to enforce an extra authenticated step within the users email address, similar to bank accounts/instagram/facebook/linked in/
