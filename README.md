IDEA
------------
The original idea was to make "WUHPF" from The Office a real thing. When we planned out how much time we had, we didn't think that we would hacve enough time to complete what we would have wanted to accomplish with it. Instead we created Furiends.

WHAT CAME EASY?
------------
- Following MVC
- Dividing work among everyone (Frontend vs Backend, UI vs UX, api vs html routes)
- Learning new tech
- Having a 5th group-mate to contribute to the project and share ideas with
- Coming up with the initial idea, future development and knowing what we want our project to do
- Having similar interests in animals, animal memes and pets
- Sticking to the LCD

CHALLENGES
------------
- Getting passport to work correctly (Cudos to Oscar for figuring it out before Graydon released the code)
- Getting the Database to talk to the HTML page via routes (Forgetting that you need API AND HTML routes)
- Correct Javascript Syntax (Forever forgetting to spell correctly, that "," or that ";")
- Github (Commiting changes to the same file but different lines)
- Forgetting to change the package.JSON after someone elses github commit (The feeling after seeing tons of red lines in your console after launching the program localally to test but knowing everything's right - the package.json file)
- Only having a week and a half to develop a Full Stack Web Program! (We had a couple great ideas we wanted to pursue but we felt that time would play a crucial factor considering work, kids, getting things working, deploying to heroku and NOT blowing the project up,)

FUTURE DEVELOPMENT
------------
- More user features such as finding specific breed pictures, specific users, 
- Background texture that changes as you scroll through the "infinite scrolling"
- An animated pet in the nav bar that walks around and you can click on for help
- Being able to organize pet meetups between users/developers (Similar to OTAB)
- Giving users more access to pet information such as breed specific info, pet friendly bars/parks, quick access to a "PetWebMD"
- Adding more and more users and having it be used frequently so that some of these future ideas can become realities
